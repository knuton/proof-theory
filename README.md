Curry-Howard correspondence and Church-Rosser theorem for Ni
============================================================

We would like to illuminate the Curry-Howard correspondence as well as
the Church-Rosser theorem for the intuitionistic natural deduction
systems and the simply typed lambda calculus. For ease of exposition
we would like to focus on natural deduction systems for propositional
logic using implication as the only connective. This corresponds to
->Npi in Troelstra-Schwichtenberg terminology.

The two main goals of the presentation will be to develop and explain
the proofs-as-programs interpretation and to further show the
correspondence between normalisation in natural deduction systems and
lambda calculi.
