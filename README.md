Curry-Howard correspondence for Ni and Church-Rosser theorem
============================================================

We would like to illuminate the Curry-Howard correspondence for the
intuitionistic natural deduction systems and the simply typed lambda calculus.
For ease of exposition we would like to focus on natural deduction systems for
propositional logic using implication as the only connective. This corresponds
to ->Npi in Troelstra-Schwichtenberg terminology.

The two main goals of the presentation will be to develop and explain the
proofs-as-programs interpretation and to further show the correspondence
between the reduction of Lambda-terms and the normalisation of proofs in natural
deduction systems in light of the Church-Rosser and the Normalization theorems.
