\chapter{Conclusion}

We have seen that the structural similarities between the logical and
computational systems we examined are vast and allow a transfer of intuitions
among different domains. Although the fathers of the BHK interpretation will not
have had computers in mind, the concept of constructing the referents of one's
reasoning is a fruitful metaphor for what happens in a computer's memory during
the execution of a program. To reap more benefits from the connection we tapped
into, it might be a good idea to look at other connectives from intuitionistic
logic. Conjunctions have an obvious interpretation as pairs of terms,
disjunctions can be seen as structures containing at least one value,
corresponding to which disjuncts are true. Leaving the domain of propositional
logic we might look at universal quantifiers, relating to type-agnostic
functions that may help easing some of the complications we saw the introduction
of types bringing to lambda terms in \ref{section:ski}.
