\chapter{Prerequisites}

% Just a first version, I think this is a good place to explain our "small"
% scope
We will give brief introductions to two prerequisites for the main part of the
report. First an introduction to simply typed lambda calculus, which we will
introduce first in an untyped version and add the notion of types on this basis.
Second, in \ref{sec:naturaldeduction}, a review of natural deduction for
intuitionistic propositional implication logic.  While results similar to those
presented in later chapters exist for larger logics, we chose this relatively
narrow scope because it allows us a concise presentation of both lambda calculus
and natural deduction.

%% @todo: perhaps add an informal introduction of lambda-calculus here?
