\chapter{Curry-Howard Correspondence}

Parts of the formalisms introduced in the prerequisites appear to function
largely in parallel. When we look at the effects of functional abstraction and
function application on types in \stlambda, we might be reminded of implication
introduction and implication elimination in \implnpi. And indeed, this apparent
structural similarity can be grasped formally and turns out to be so strong that
the two formalisms are isomorphic. To support this claim we obviously need to
establish the existence of a bijection between the two systems. We can then show
that the aforementioned operations are indeed invariant under the bijection.

In the literature we referred to, proofs of the isomorphism were largely
suggestive. Although we neither want to claim to give a totally complete proof,
nor want give a totally complete proof, we were interested in seeing the details
work out and thus try to take a more formal route compared to the sources.
